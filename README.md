<strong>Simple overview over what I recommend to program in based on the:</strong>

1. GO - Literally best, that's it. Easy to install and write and work with.

2. C - Ultra simple syntax easy install but that's it

3. C#/Java - (Even thou C# is slower but I think it's a clear winner it was EASY TO INSTALL AND WORK with since
the latest changes of .Net 6 but it looks like that java is a clear winner when it comes to compute performance)

4. python - Write small things that NEVER include anything compute related (use packages that use performance langs for that)

5. php - only if you want lol
