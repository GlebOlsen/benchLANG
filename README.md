<strong>Difficulty is my personal estemations on difficulty of reading, writing and working (building or compiling/installation of the language) with a language.
Ranking (median time * total time):</strong>

|:-------:|:---------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|
| GO:     | 55.8820889988   | Difficulty: | Easy    |
| C:      | 68.1633865      | Difficulty: | Medium  |
| C#      | 102.488583333   | Difficulty: | Hard    |
| php:    | 376.690646171   | Difficulty: | Medium  |
| python: | (100 years)*5.4 | Difficulty: | Easiest |

<strong>Simple overview over what I recommend to program in based on the:</strong>

1. GO - Literally best, that's it. Easy to install and write and work with.

2. C - Ultra simple syntax easy install but that's it

3. C#/Java - (Even thou C# is slower but I think it's a clear winner it was EASY TO INSTALL AND WORK with since
the latest changes of .Net 6 but it looks like that java is a clear winner when it comes to compute performance)

4. python - Write small things that NEVER include anything compute related (use packages that use performance langs for that)

5. php - only if you want lol
